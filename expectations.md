##What you can expect from your advisor
Every advisor is unique. Each advisor has his or her own ideas about everything from qualifiers, to publishing, to making pizza. You cannot expect your advisor to be exactly like any other, just as you are not like any other student. What you can expect, however, is for your advisor to adhere to the following general guidelines.

####Communication: 
Communication is the most important facet of your working relationship with your advisor. You can expect your advisor to clearly communicate his or her thoughts and expectations to you. When your advisor is not communicative about key topics, you should feel right at home approaching him or her for clarification. 

*Expectations:* Your advisor should clearly communicate his or her expectations. Your advisor's expectations regarding the following things are especially important:
* *Quals:* Timeframe, publishability, scope
* *Generals:* Timeframe, style, scope, communication during the exam, relationship to thesis
* *Progress:* Milestones, publications

*Meetings:* How you and your advisor communicate with each other is also important. Face to face interactions allow for collaboration, progress reporting, and mentoring. You can expect your advisor to:
* Meet with you regularly
* Actively consider your ideas during meetings
* Be available for extra face time within a couple of days of a request.
* Respond to your communications promptly
* Schedule/cancel meetings at least a day in advance, when possible
* Tell you if he or she is leaving town

*Feedback:* Receiving feedback from your advisor will help you to adjust your performance to meet his or her expectations. Expect:
* Honest feedback
* Constructive criticism
* Positive feedback
* An occasional "kick," for encouragement

####Research Advising: 
One of your top priorities in graduate school will be research. Agreeing on a clear research agenda is crucial to both you and your advisor. Expect your advisor to:
* Know your research goals
* Provide research direction according to your level, ambition, and independence
* Assess your individual needs
* Save state between meetings
* Communicate about conferences and publishing
* Give direction/help with technical problems

*Logistics:* Program milestones and funding can be sources of confusion for younger students. Expect your advisor to:
* Understand the program milestones that you must pass
* Make your funding status very clear
* Help you find other sources of funding such as TA-ships or fellowships should an RA-ship not be available

####Mentoring: 
A major role of faculty members is to mentor students. From the faculty side, mentoring involves:
* Helping you choose career direction, research direction, and professional activities
* Knowing your educational, cultural, and employment background
* Knowing your educational and professional goals

*Guiding:* Part of mentoring is creating well rounded students. Expect your advisor to guide you to:
* Plan and perform research
* Teach in a classroom setting
* Communicate your research and ideas effectively
* Get you started on writing grants and research proposals
* Work on service committees
* Mentor younger students

*Networking:* As is often true elsewhere, it's not what you know, it's who you know. Expect your advisor to:
* Advocate for you, both inside and outside the department.
* At conferences, to take the time to introduce you to his contacts
* Utilize his or her professional network during job searches
* Nominate you for fellowships and awards you deserve

In an ideal world, every student's advisor would be his or her mentor. However, this may not always be possible or beneficial. In the case that your research advisor is not mentoring you well, it would be beneficial for you to discuss this with your advisor, or to seek advice from another faculty member.

By understanding your advisor's expectations and by meeting or exceeding those expectations, you are helping to assure your success in graduate school. So, what can your advisor expect from you?

####Communication: 
As we've continually stressed, communication is the key to success. Your advisor expects you to:
* Speak up if problems arise
* Listen to what he/she says
* Respect his/her ideas
* Accept constructive criticism
* Provide honest progress reporting
* Respond promptly to communication

*Meetings:* Just as you can expect your advisor to meet with you face-to-face, you'll find that faculty also have expectations regarding meetings.
* Prepare appropriately, otherwise reschedule
* Show up on time
* Attend all group meetings and relevant 590's
* Meet on advisor's request, with reasonable notice

Each advisor has different expectations about the performance of his or her students. Keep in mind the following expectations your advisor has for you so things run smoothly:
* Show initiative
* Do what you've promised
* Produce high quality work
* Regular progress
* Meet agreed-upon goals

*Grunt Work:* Let's face it. This place does not run itself. As a graduate student, faculty expect you to:
* Maintain labs, software, and hardware for your group
* Document your research, designs, code, and meetings
* Be a TA, especially for niche subjects

####Professional Development: 
You are in graduate school to become world-class researchers as well as well rounded potential faculty members. You're expected to:
* Own your own career
* Actively consider future research directions
* Be willing to mentor younger students (grads and undergrads)
* Write paper reviews
* Attend conferences/workshops
* Stay updated on relevant research

*Personal issues:* We are all human. We all know that school is not the only thing in our life. However, faculty have expectations regarding your priorities and vacation time:
* Make CSE your number one priority, especially regarding consulting, outside jobs, etc.
* Take vacation, but schedule it appropriately
* Stay interested in your work
* Understand that faculty members are juggling a lot: teaching, research, advising, committees, and their families, too!
