## The First Year

In your first year or so at UW, you should find a research topic to get started on. Part of finding a research topic is finding a research advisor to do the work with. When you come into the department, you'll have a *temporary advisor* who should help you through this process. Most people start doing research with their temporary advisor, who will eventually become their "real" advisor. But that's not true for everyone---sometimes, you need to find a new topic, a new advising relationship, or both. Here's some advice for looking for a good topic/advising match.

### Don't Panic

First, give yourself a break. There's no need to panic if you don't win the Turing award on on your first day at UW. Most people need some time to find a direction and get started.

There's a wide variance: people work at different paces, so don't worry if you meet other grad students who might be progressing faster than you. If you need help calibrating your progress, your grad student mentor can be great resource. They have a better perspective on what counts as "fast" or "slow" than your fellow first-year grad students.

### Looking for a Topic

If you're not sure yet which broad research area in CSE you want to pursue, here are a few ways to find out what's available:

* Go to colloquium: most weeks, a world expert will give a talk about some different area of computer science.
* Show up to the poster sessions and talks for the department's [industry affiliates][affiliates] days, which usually happen in October. Other students will be showing off their current projects, so it's a perfect time to ask them about what's going on in their groups.
* Watch the talks at the [CSE Symposium][cses], a new tradition where students give more polished talks on their work.
* Register for the department's seminars, colloquially known as "five nineties." Most of these involve students leading informal discussions about papers each week. Sign up to present a paper on a topic that's new to you.
* If you can get someone to fund you, travel to a conference on an area you might be interested. This is a great way not just to learn about current work in an area but also to meet people from its research community.

### Finding an Advisor

If you have a topic in mind, the next step is to find a faculty member to advise you. This means finding a potential advisor who seems like a good technical and personal fit---and means convincing them that you're a good match. Here are some tips for finding and talking to a good potential advisor.

* Younger faculty with fewer students can be more approachable than senior professors who might already be at advising capacity.
* Consider starting by taking a class with someone you might want to work with. This can both of you get a sense for each other.
* Talk to the professor's current grad students to introduce yourself and find out what it's like to work with them.
* Before you talk to a potential advisor, read some of their recent papers so you have something to talk about. Come up with an interesting question or two to ask about their work.

### Getting Going

If you have a (tentative) advisor, it's time to get started on your research. Your advisor should help you find a specific topic and point you in the right direction. Here are some things to keep in mind as you get started:

* Read closely and often. Learning to read papers from your area with a critical eye can be crucial to doing great work yourself.
* Start by working with a senior grad student. Your advisor can help you find a research project that's underway that you can help with. Pairing up with someone more experienced is a great way to learn the ropes before you launch your own research agenda.
* Be excited about your work. Doing great research when you don't care about it is next to impossible. Be sure to communicate openly with your advisor about what you like (and don't) about research---advisors can't know you're unhappy if you toil in silence.
