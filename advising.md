# Expectations in Advising

_Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Oct. 2005_


## A note from the chair

The success of UW Computer Science & Engineering depends enormously on
the success of our students, which in turn depends on active and
thoughtful advising relationships between students and their advisors.
This document is based on a tremendous amount of work by our
graduate students, including extensive discussions, surveys, and a session
at the 2005 annual departmental retreat. The goal is to make us all
better participants in the advising relationship by increasing the
clarity of the responsibilities and by increasing our mindfulness of
this critically valuable and important process.

My personal advising and mentoring philosophy is drawn from my own
Ph.D. advisor, Nico Habermann, who said to focus on graduating terrific
students, which guarantees terrific research---focusing on terrific
research may or may not lead to the graduating of terrific students.

The material in this document contains wonderful advice for students, and
I recommend you read it carefully and keep it around to refer to now
and then.

Best of luck in finding an advising relationship that can help you
reach beyond your own expectations---we know you can, and we're
ready to help!

## Communication is the key

Your advising relationship is the most important academic relationship that you
have during your graduate career. The success of this relationship depends on
many factors: personalities, interests, styles, and most importantly,
communication. Getting an early start on building an open relationship with
your advisor increases your chances of being successful and of enjoying
graduate school.

As a graduate student, you will learn more than you ever thought you could
about computer science, research, education, and hopefully, relationships. You
will meet many new people and form personal bonds that will last a lifetime.
Undeniably, with regards to your success in graduate school, none of the
relationships you form in graduate school will affect your career more than the
one you form with your advisor.

An advisor and student craft their relationship over the course of many years,
creating a trust that centers around the meeting of expectations that
each one has for the other. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that you understand what you can expect from your advisor, and what he or she can expect from you.

Above all, it is important to remember that the biggest driving factor behind
your success in graduate school is you. It is your responsibility to take
charge of your own career and its direction. Faculty members, and your advisor
specifically, while supervising your progress, cannot help you advance without
you giving 100% effort.


## The Advisor/Advisee Relationship

(Merge "Mentoring" and "What you can expect from your advisor" sections here...)

### What you can expect from your advisor

The first thing you should understand about advisors is that each is unique.
Each advisor has his or her own ideas about everything from quals, to
publishing, to making pizza. You cannot expect your advisor to be exactly like
any other, just as you are not like any other student.

What you can expect, however, is for your advisor to communicate his or her
thoughts and ideas to you, especially when they pertain directly to your life.
When your advisor is not communicative about key topics, you should feel right
at home approaching him or her for clarification.

Communication: Communication is the most important facet of your working
relationship with your advisor. Your advisor should clearly communicate his or
her expectations. Your advisor's expectations regarding the following things
are especially important.

* Quals: Timeframe, publishability, scope
* Generals: Timeframe, style, scope, communication during the exam, relationship to thesis
* Progress: Milestones, publications

How you and your advisor communicate with each other is also important. You can
expect your advisor to adhere to the following ground rules.

* Regularly scheduled meetings
* Active consideration of your ideas during meetings
* Prompt email response

Feedback: Receiving feedback from your advisor will help you to adjust your
performance to meet his or her expectations. Expect:

* Honest feedback
* Constructive criticism
* Positive feedback
* An occasional "kick," for encouragement

Mentoring: A major role of faculty members is to mentor students. From the faculty side, mentoring involves:

* Helping you choose career direction, research direction, and professional activities
* Knowing your educational, cultural, and employment background
* Knowing your educational and professional goals

Part of mentoring is creating well rounded students. Expect
your advisor to guide you to:

* Plan and perform research
* Teach in a classroom setting
* Communicate your research and ideas effectively
* Work on service committees
* Mentor younger students

### What you can expect from your advisor: Top five...

1. Clear communication
2. Constructive criticism
3. Positive feedback
4. Career mentoring
5. Regular meetings

### Mentoring

In an ideal world, every student's advisor would be his or her mentor.
However, this may not always be possible or beneficial. In the case that your
research advisor is not mentoring you well, it would be beneficial for you to
discuss this with your advisor, or to seek advice from another faculty member.

Networking: As is often true elsewhere, it's not what you know, it's who you
know. Expect your advisor to:

* Advocate for you, both inside and outside the department.
* At conferences, to take the time to introduce you to his contacts
* Utilize his or her professional network during job searches
* Nominate you for fellowships and awards you deserve

Research Advising: One of your top priorities here will be research. Expect your advisor to:

* Know your research goals
* Provide research direction according to your level, ambition, and
  independence
* Assess your individual needs
* Save state between meetings
* Communicate about conferences and publishing
* Give direction/help with technical problems

Meetings: Face to face interactions allow collaboration, progress reporting,
and mentoring time for students. Expect your advisor to:

* Meet with you regularly
* Be available for extra face time within a couple of days of a request.
* Respect your time by showing up on time
* Not read email during meetings
* Schedule/cancel meetings at least a day in advance, when possible
* Tell you if he or she is leaving town

Logistics: Program milestones and funding can be sources of confusion for
younger students. Expect your advisor to:

* Understand the program milestones that you must pass.
* Make your funding status very clear
* Help you find other sources of funding such as TA-ships or fellowships should
  an RA-ship not be available


### Mentor vs. Boss

What's the tone of your relationship? Our department culture fosters the idea
that students and faculty are colleagues, an idea most students prefer.
However, reality dictates that faculty are "colleagues with authority." It is
important to maintain balance in your advising relationship.* Does your advisor
treat you as a colleague rather than an employee?

* Does your advisor help you make decisions that are in your best interest?
* Does your research involve you implementing your advisors ideas or more joint
  brainstorming and collaboration?
* Does your advisor respect your personal nonwork time?


### What do you like about your advisor?

The following are direct responses from a survey of
graduate students.

* "My advisor genuinely cares about his students---both professionally and
  personally."
* "He is pleasant and funny and we make jokes frequently."
* "...great at discussing research and publications."
* "I like his willingness to share ideas."
* "...being considerate, not only on research, but also on my career and
  personal life."
* "My advisor is very encouraging and keeps me motivated and directed."


### Joint advising?

One advisor isn't enough? Perhaps consider a co-advising situation with
complementary faculty members.


### What your advisor can expect from you

By understanding your advisor's expectations and by meeting or exceeding those
expectations, you are helping to assure your success in graduate school. So,
what can your advisor expect from you?

Communication: As we've continually stressed, communication is the key to
success. Your advisor expects you to:

* Speak up if problems arise
* Listen to what he/she says
* Respect his/her ideas
* Accept constructive criticism
* Provide honest progress reporting
* Respond promptly to communication

Performance: Each advisor has different expectations about the performance of
his or her students. Keep in mind the following expectations your advisor has
for you so things run smoothly.

* Show initiative
* Do what you've promised
* Produce high quality work
* Regular progress
* Meet agreed-upon goals

Meetings: Just as you can expect your advisor to meet with you face-to-face,
you'll find that faculty also have expectations regarding meetings.

* Prepare appropriately, otherwise reschedule
* Show up on time
* Attend all group meetings and relevant 590's
* Meet on advisor's request, with reasonable notice

Professional Development: You are in graduate school to become world-class
researchers as well as well rounded potential faculty members. You're expected
to:

* Own your own career
* Actively consider future research directions
* Be willing to mentor younger students (grads and ugrads)
* Write paper reviews
* Attend conferences/workshops
* Stay updated on relevant research

Grunt Work: Let's face it. This place does not run itself. As a graduate
student, faculty expect you to:

* Maintain labs, software, and hardware for your group
* Document your research, designs, code, and meetings
* Be a TA, especially for niche subjects

Personal issues: We are all human. We all know that school
is not the only thing in our life. However, faculty have expectations regarding your priorities and vacation time.

* Make CSE your number one priority, especially regarding consulting, outside
  jobs, etc.
* Take vacation, but schedule it appropriately
* Stay interested in your work
* Understand that faculty members are juggling a lot: teaching, research,
  advising, committees, and their families, too!

### What your advisor can expect from you: Top five...

1. Own your own career
2. Accept constructive criticism
3. Honest progress reports
4. Initiative
5. High quality work

### A big transition

From consumer to producer Graduate school is your time to make the transition
from knowledge consumer to knowledge producer. It is a difficult transition
that everyone makes in their own time. Acquiring the skills necessary to make
this transition is something that can only happen through interaction with
experienced researchers, like your advisors.



## Dealing with Potential Problems

We always hope that things go well. Sometimes, they don't. Here's what to do.

1. **Don't wait. Deal with it NOW.** Problems in advising relationships, just as in any other relationship, cannot be resolved without good communication. Almost all issues can be solved by simply having an open and honest conversation with your advisor. The earlier you talk to your advisor, the easier it is to resolve most problems.
2. **Poll your officemates, mentors, and groupmates.** Chances are, your older officemates have been there. Leverage that experience when you can.
3. **Talk to your grad student mentor.** Upon entering the Ph.D. program, you were assigned a student mentor. This mentor has likely experienced most of the same issues you may experience and can therefore provide you with useful advice.  
3. **Talk to the Grad. Program Coordinator, Anna Karlin (karlin@cs)** Anna is a wealth of information and is more than happy to lend her expertise to helping resolve your problem.
4. **Talk to Elise (elised@cs)** Elise, as we all know, is one of the most valuable resources we have as graduate students. If you are unable to resolve a particular conflict, let Elise weigh in on your problem.
5. **Talk to Hank Levy, Dept. Chair** Having been a faculty member for many years, Hank has experience with all facets of the advising experience. He also happens to be a nice guy.

Note that these solutions apply to almost any issue you could have during your grad student experience. Below, we provide a list of issues that grad student have run into in the past. Keep in mind that every one of these issues can be resolved by following the suggestions above!

1. I want to work with Prof. X, how do I ask them?

A simple introduction email can go a long way! Reach out and ask to set up a meeting with Professor X. Before going to the meeting, make sure you have something interesting to say. That is, you should have read several of the recent papers written by this professor so you know what he/she is working on. 

2. I am not happy with my current research project, what should I do?

Have you talked to your advisor about this yet? Having open and honest communication with your advisor is critical to your success. If the project you are working on isn't interesting to you, then talk to your advisor about how you can either shift the focus of the project or come up with a different project to fit your interests. That being said, grad school is tough, and research is not often going to be easy. Make sure you aren't quitting a project because it is difficult. Working through difficulties in research is a skill all Ph.D. students are expected to learn. 

3. I'm not sure what research area I am interested in, how can I find a research area?

You have several resources at your disposal. First, take seminars in areas that you may be interested in. Seminars often provide a broad overview of the current state of the art in different subfields through paper readings. Second, take a look at the websites for different research groups in the department and speak to current grad students in the groups that seem most appealing to you. Finally, talk with your temporary advisor. They are often a wealth of information and can help point you in the right direction. 

4. I am worried my advisor is not happy with my research progress.

Being repetitive, have you talked to your advisor about this yet? You should be having regular conversations about your progress and your advisor should express their expectations to you clearly. If you aren't sure, then talk to them!

5. It seems like everyone else is making a lot more progress than me.

This is a very common sentiment in newer grad students, although it is often not well founded. Again, grad school is tough. Things will not always go as planned, and often, projects will take a lot of work to make only moderate progress. This is normal. Don't compare yourself to other grad students. Instead, make sure that your advisor is satisfied with the progress you are making by discussing it with them. 

6. My advisor is never available. How can I get them to make time for me?



7. I feel like I spend so much time doing coursework or TA'ing that I don't have anytime for research. What should I do?



8. My advisor said he doesn't want to work with me.



9. I no longer want to work with my current advisor.



10. I don't get along with my current advisor.



11. My advisor is very demanding, and I think he expects more of me than I can provide.
